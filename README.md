# The Ultimate Guide to Pwning

A comprehensive and growing textbook on topics in information security built by
students at the National University of Singapore as part of the NUS Greyhats
security interest group.

It was started as a project by Jeremy Heng (@nn\_amon) as an effort to create a
taxonomy of hacking knowledge.

## Introduction

This book was designed as a sort of encyclopedia containing an in-depth guide to
hacking techiques useful for, primarily, capture-the-flag competitions as well
as some real life applications.

Feel free to skip to sections that pique your interest. They are intended to be
separately understandable for a sufficiently advanced reader. New readers are
advised to cover the basics in the earlier chapters before moving onto the later
ones.
