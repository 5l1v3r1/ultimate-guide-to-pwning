# The Ultimate Guide to Pwning

A comprehensive and growing textbook on topics in information security built by
students at the National University of Singapore as part of the NUS Greyhats
security interest group.

It was started as a project by Jeremy Heng (@nn\_amon) as an effort to create a
taxonomy of hacking knowledge.

## Introduction

as some real life applications.

Feel free to skip to sections that pique your interest. They are intended to be
separately understandable.
